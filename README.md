# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the project work for the course "Data Analysis and Machine Learning" at the University of Applied Science (FHDW) Bielefeld. The project includes a `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) file and the corresponding `.r` script, which perform a specific data analysis and machine learning task as part of the course requirements.

## Installation

To run the code provided in this repository, you will need to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

### Step 1: Install R

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

1. Visit the [R Project website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Install RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

1. Visit the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
2. Download the RStudio Desktop installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Usage

### Importing and Running the `.qmd` File

The `.qmd` (Quarto Markdown) file contains the main documentation and code chunks for the analysis. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows for dynamic, reproducible documents.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Install Quarto by following the [installation instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
3. Open the `.qmd` file in RStudio.
4. Click on the "Render" button to execute the code and generate the output document (e.g., HTML, PDF).

### Running the `.r` File

The `.r` file contains the R script necessary for the analysis. To run it:

1. Open RStudio.
2. Open the `.r` file in RStudio.
3. Run the code by clicking "Run" or using the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl` + `Enter` for Windows/Linux, `Cmd` + `Enter` for macOS) to execute individual lines or code blocks.
